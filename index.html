                                        <p> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Book </p>
                                        <p> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very exciting and spellbinding (*wink wink* get it?") book. It is about a boy named Harry who becomes a wizard. He is off on a journey to the school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts! He makes friends and enemies. Read this book to journey through his magical adventures! </p>
                                        <p> My Opinion : I thought that this book was an awesome book to read. Anyone of any age can be able to read it. If you love reading the genres fantasy and action,then this book is for you. The book is in a series of 7 books (including this one), so prepare to read a lot if you choose to read! The author also has a website if you finish reading the books and are interested, the links lined below. </p>
